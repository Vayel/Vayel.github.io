  <p>
  I have a <strong>Master’s Degree in Computer Science</strong> (<a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/">Ensimag</a>, France) and work as a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> and <strong>Python Developer</strong>. I have professional experience with <a href="https://github.com/IEMLdev/django-intlekt">Django</a> and data analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
With the two years I spent in <a href="https://mpsilamartin.github.io/">French preparatory classes</a> and the courses at Ensimag, I have a background in Computer Science and Mathematics. During these five years, I learned to work efficiently and rigorously on complex problems, especially as a member of <a href="http://www.nsigma.fr/">Nsigma</a>, Ensimag's Junior Company.

I love completing this education on my own, with Internet resources and personal and open-source projects, especially in Python. Most of them are available on <a href="https://github.com/Vayel">GitHub</a>. Besides, I get involved in <a href="https://zestedesavoir.com/">Zeste de Savoir</a>, a French website sharing knowledge for free, on which I publish articles about multiple topics. I am also a <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/team/#shifters">Shifter</a> and I signed the <a href="https://pour-un-reveil-ecologique.fr/index.php">Manifeste étudiant pour un réveil écologique</a>.
