  Currently ending a <strong>Master Degree at Ensimag</strong> (École nationale
  supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées, France) in <strong>
  Information Systems Engineering</strong>, I am looking for a <strong>6-month internship</strong>
  from <strong>February 2018</strong> in <strong>deep learning</strong>, preferably
  abroad.
  </p>

  <p>
  With the two years I spent in French preparatory classes and the courses at
  Ensimag, I acquired a <strong>strong background</strong> in <strong>computer
  science</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong>.
  These last five years, I learned to work <strong>efficiently</strong> and
  <strong>rigorously</strong> on complex problems.
  </p>

  <p>
  I love completing this education <strong>on my own</strong>, with Internet resources and <strong>personal</strong>
  and <strong>open-source projects</strong>, especially in <strong>Python</strong>. Most of them are available on
  <a href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>. Besides, I get involved in
  <a href="https://zestedesavoir.com/">Zeste de Savoir</a>, a French website
  sharing knowledge for free, on which I <strong>publish</strong> various
  <strong><a href="{{ site.zestedesavoir_url }}">articles</a></strong>.
  I also daily consult <strong>machine-learning-related websites</strong> such as
  <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill.pub</a>,
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">reddit</a>,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval YouTube channel</a>,
  <a href="https://blog.openai.com/">OpenAI blog</a>,
  <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/">DeepMind blog</a>,
  <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy blog</a>,
  <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Chris Olah blog</a>...
  </p>

  <p>
  Last but not least, I worked for <strong>Junior Company Nsigma</strong>, through
  which I experienced the <strong>business world</strong> and <strong>team work</strong>.
  As a project manager and a programmer, I developed my <strong>communication</strong> and
  <strong>analytic skills</strong>.
