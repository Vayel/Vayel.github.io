  I am a Master Degree student at Ensimag (École nationale
  supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées, France) in computer science
  (Information Systems Engineering).
  </p>

  <p>
  With the two years I spent in French preparatory classes and the courses at
  Ensimag, I acquired a strong background in computer
  science and mathematics.
  These last five years, I learned to work efficiently and
  rigorously on complex problems.

  I love completing this education on my own, with Internet resources and personal
  and open-source projects, especially in Python. Most of them are available on
  <a href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>. Besides, I get involved in
  <a href="https://zestedesavoir.com/">Zeste de Savoir</a>, a French website
  sharing knowledge for free, on which I publish various
  <a href="{{ site.zestedesavoir_url }}">articles</a>.
  I also daily consult machine-learning-related websites such as
  <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill.pub</a>,
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">reddit</a> or
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval YouTube channel</a>.

  Additionally, I worked for Junior Company Nsigma, through
  which I experienced the business world and team work.
  As a project manager and a programmer, I developed my communication and
  analytic skills.

  In my free time, I practice climbing, caving
  and canyoning. I am a volunteer for
  <a href="https://www.esmug-gucem.fr/">GUCEM</a>, a French mountaineering club. In
  addition to sport, I enjoy philosophy and science
  in general, among others. I regularly watch educational videos on YouTube:

  Last but not least, I practice yoga and meditation, for introspection-related
  purpose.
